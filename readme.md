## Overview

I worked as a Full-stack developer Intern at Solar Secure Solutions for 2 months, from 8th June
to 9th August 2022. During my internship, I built many projects, including front-end, REST APIs,
back-end, and full-stack projects. I completed the provided tasks and study material as per the
mentioned timeline and completed my internship successfully.
During this internship, I gained industrial experience in web development and learned some best
practices for writing modular and efficient code. I also learned how to deploy web applications
and use JSON files as databases.
